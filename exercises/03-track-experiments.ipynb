    "# Experiment tracking with MLflow 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Running experiments in data science projects is a common task. We have run one in the previous notebook. However, it is often difficult to keep track of all the experiments that have been run by you or by your colleagues, and to compare the results between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how to use the MLflow library for experiment tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after training our model. We will use an MLflow server to:\n",
    "- Log our model configuration (features, architecture, etc.)\n",
    "- Log our test score\n",
    "- Log the model\n",
    "- Log additional artifacts, such as figures\n",
    "- *Register* a model if the model is better than the rest\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** An MLflow server has been spun up for you in the background. It is hosted somewhere in the cloud, so everyone can access it. **In case the server breaks**, you may run the following in your terminal to spin up an mlflow server locally:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mlflow server --default-artifact-root ./mlruns --host 0.0.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Make sure, in that case, to use the tracking uri (e.g. `http://0.0.0.0:5000`) instead of the one provided below and throughout the rest of the tutorial."
